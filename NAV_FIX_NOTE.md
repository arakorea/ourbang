# Note about assets/images
This package only updates navigation styles and active states.
Your existing deployment should already include assets/images/* referenced by the HTML.

Files updated:
- assets/css/site.css (Unified Navigation Style + active state)
- index.html, explore.html, scan.html, vision.html, mirror.html (adds class="is-active" on the correct nav link)

Deployment: upload/replace these files on your server.
